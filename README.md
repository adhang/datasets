# Machine Learning Datasets
This repository contains a copy of machine learning datasets used in my personal projects. It's not my dataset, but it's a collection from various sources.
<br><br>
This repository was created to ensure that the datasets used in my projects remain available and are not dependent upon unreliable third parties.
<br><br>
The dataset description can be found on the `source` link or `.names` file if available.
